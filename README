Perl5 HELP for Windows (winhlp32)

Based on perlpod 5.005_62 (ie 5.6) and pod2rtf 1.51

Note that the winhelp creatable by tex2html is different and has
less errors, but is not avalaible for the latest perldocs.
It also includes the latest updates for my old pod2rtf hack v1.51 
(a mess but it works)

Size: 1.4MB zipped, 1.8MB unzipped

Location:
  <URL:http://www.perl.com//CPAN/authors/id/RURBAN/perlhlp5-1.51.zip>

Changes:
1.51: 1999-12-29
  - fixed perlre pages:
    the most important 2nd page was missing from 1.4 (not at CPAN)
  - improved and more condensed layout (fixed paragraphs)
  - added perlopentut, perlreftut, perltootc, perlthrtut, perldbmfilter,
    perltodo, win32, perlcompile, perlhack
1.40: 1999-07-19
  - new perl5 build based on the 5.005_02 pods
    the former was based on 5.003 or 5.004 pods (don't know anymore)
  - renamed from perl.hlp tp perl5.hlp
    but missed one important page (perlre)
1.3: ?? rurban
  - internal only
1.2: 1996-12-05 rurban
  - based on pod2rtf.pl 1.2 and perlpod 5.004 
  - perl.hlp included 3 early ActiveWare (316?) pods
    (win32, win32ext, oleauto)
  - manually fixed to include perlsyn statements (for, while, if, ...)
1.0: 1996-05-07 rurban
  - orginal version on CPAN as perlhlp.zip,
    based on 5.003 with some manual fixes

Bugs, Future directions of pod2rtf.pl
- Some help pages are empty.
  v1.52 will fix that and will be based on 5.005_63. (aka 5.6)
- A Pod::Parser based pod2rtf and merging with Aldo Capini's Pod::RTF 
  is in the works, but advances are slow.
- Improved automatic navigation window as with tex2html
- Automatic CNT creation based on perl.doc
- A full Win32 chm (compressed html) [1.8MB] is also at my website, 
  which includes also the standard extensions and modules.
  As with the winhelp it includes a toc navbar, index and fulltext
  search (in contrast to plain html).
- Think over the current pagebreak rationale
